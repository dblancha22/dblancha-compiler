This directory contains a number of example tests to exercise
your scanner assignment.  (You should write some additional tests as well.)
good*.bminor should scan correctly, and bad*.bminor should not.
Note that the good files will not necessarily parse, typecheck,
or compile, they are just sequences of valid tokens.

Note that run_all_tests.sh will quickly test your compiler on
all the tests, assuming that it is in your path and produces
a proper exit code from main (which it should!)
