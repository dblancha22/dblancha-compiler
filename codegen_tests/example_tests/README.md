These are some complete bminor programs that you could use
as a starting point to test your compiler.  Note that they do
not provide complete test coverage, you still need to write
your own tests!

To try them out, add your bminor compiler to your `PATH`,
and then type `make`.

* bounce.bminor draws a bouncing box on the screen, using the X11 gfx library.
* fibonnacci.bminor computes tables of the Fibonnacci numbers.
* maze.bminor prints out a random maze using ascii characters.
